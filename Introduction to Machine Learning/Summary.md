### Summary:
**Introduction to Machine Learning** was a beginner-level introduction to the field.
I had not taken the Programming Fundamentals course yet so this was a warp-speed introduction to coding in Python, condensed in a 10-week Summer course.
We were given O'Reilly's *Machine Learning With Python* as our course textbook, which I still reference today.
My favorite project was working with the Titanic dataset from Kaggle, which I've attached. It was particularly illustrative in how machine learning models work.
