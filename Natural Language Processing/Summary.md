### Summary:

**Natural Language Processing (NLP)** is a field of AI that allows computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. 
It converts text or speech into data that machines can analyze using techniques like tokenization, parsing, and machine learning. 
Modern NLP relies heavily on deep learning and transformer models, which enable tasks such as translation, sentiment analysis, text 
classification, chatbots, and speech recognition. In simple terms, NLP helps computers communicate with people in a more natural, human-like way.
