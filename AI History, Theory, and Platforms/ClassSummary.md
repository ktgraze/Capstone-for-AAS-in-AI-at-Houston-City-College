### Summary:
This introductory class layed the groundwork for what was to come by introducing students to the general concepts and history of Artificial Intelligence. We learned about the big names in the field like Alan Turing and Marvin Minksy as well as the companies making an impact today, like IBM and NVIDIA. I've attached my Final Exam presentation which highlights my key learning and greatest takeaways.
