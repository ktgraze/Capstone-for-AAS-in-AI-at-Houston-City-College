### Summary:
Professor Srikanth Bhakthan encouraged us to explore using LLMs as aids in completing assignments. This class was my first introduction to using Streamlit, Visual Studio Code, and working with APIs. My favorite project is attached in a separate file, where Professor Sri tasked us with pitching a startup company in the domain of our choice. It opened my eyes to the possibilities of brainstorming using AI.
