### Summary:

**AI in Cybersecurity** was an extensive introduction to traditional cybersecurity practices and 
to new machine learning tactics that bad actors are utilizing to hack systems.
We learned about offensive and defensive security, Red Teams, Blue Teams, pentesting, and incident response protocol. 

Resources: The website <https://tryhackme.com/dashboard> was the main source of our learning and a resource I still use to this day.
The site gameifies all aspects of cybersecurity, which makes learning fun. 
TryHackMe also uses virtual machines and sandboxes, my introduction to both. 
Additionally, we were exposed to careers that we'd be most suitable for based on personality and interests, an example is below:
